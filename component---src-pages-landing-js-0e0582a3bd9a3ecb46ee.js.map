I went to high school at Notre Dame Prep where I took on leadership roles from\n                    President of the Computer Club to President of Anime Club and many things in between. I also had the opportunity to be a part of\n                    the Yale Young Global Scholars Beijing Program and attend summer courses at Carnegie Mellon\n                    University.

Firstly, I assisted in doing thorough\n                    literature review to help develop a research question, and then we proceeded to experiment using\n                    certain methods with the Cornell Movie Dialogue Corpus and word2vec in Python. I declared Computer Science\n                    in the College of Engineering and a minor in Statistics through U of M's LSA department, as I'm very\n                        interested in data analysis and data science.\n                        </p>\n                    <p>I also have two dogs who will always be puppies in my eyes.</p>\n                </div>\n            </section>\n            <section id=\"two\" className=\"spotlights\">\n                <section>\n                    <Link to=\"/generic\" className=\"image\">\n                        <img src={pic08} alt=\"\" />\n                    </Link>\n                    <div className=\"content\">\n                        <div className=\"inner\">\n                            <header className=\"major\">\n                                <h3>Why am I passionate about work?</h3>\n                            </header>\n                            <p>My primary concern with all the work I do is that it requires creative thinking\n                            and will have a real effect for people.
