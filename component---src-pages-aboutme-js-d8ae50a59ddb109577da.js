I believe the deconstruction of complexity and systems can drive processes towards their peak potential. I also believe analysis is at the core of this complexity, and taking apart data to its basic foundations allows us to write a story about the happenings of the world. Through this deconstruction and analysis, we can begin to truly understand problems at their core and work to improve them from the ground roots up.

It can be very easy to separate the world of art from the world of STEM using rhetoric of left-brained activities versus right-brained activities.
